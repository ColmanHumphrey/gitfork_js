# gitfork_js
Two functions that don't seem to do the right thing! For testing forking.

## say_hello.js
This function is supposed to take in a name, say hello, and tell the person how many characters their name has. But it's not working at all. Can you correct it please? It should give:
```
say_hello("amaris")
-> "Hello amaris! Your name has 6 characters"
```

## second_max_index.js
This function isn't in bad shape - it's supposed to take two arrays, find the index of the second largest value, and return the value in that location in the second array. But it isn't quite doing the right thing now. Check it out for me.
